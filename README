Question 2:

Pseudo-code:

searcher(P, S):
    m = P.length
    n = S.length
    isFound = false
    for i in range(n - m):
        if P = (S from i to i + m):
            isFound = true

Time complexity:
    There is the loop with n - m iterations, while in each iteration we provide only one comparison
    so the complexity of the algorithm is O(n-m) = O(n)
