Question 2:

Pseudo-code:

searcher(P, S):
    m = P.length
    n = S.length
    isFound = false
    for i in range(n - m):
        part = S from i to i + m
        isMatch = true
        for j in range(m):
            if part[j] != P[j]:
                isMatch = false
        if isMatch == true:
            isFound = true


Time complexity:
    There are two loops one inside another. In the first one there are n - m iterations,
        while in each iteration there is a loop with m iterations and in each of them there is only
        one simple action (comparison of two chars).
        So the complexity of the algorithm is O((n-m)*m)
